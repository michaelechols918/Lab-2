    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <q>You don't have to be smart to laugh at farts, but you have to be stupid
      not to.</q><strong>-Louis CK</strong>.
      <p>Originally from "Hot'Lanta" but I've always felt like I have been apart
         of the PSNW since birth. I have a black belt in Kung Fu and Street
         Fighter. I have a green thumb and a passion for photography as well.
        You could find me in a bookstore reading Kafka, or sipping Kombucha
        while making beats on Abelton. I majored in Culinary Arts and I want to
       bring my love for food to the WWWW's and create wonderful sites and apps
       to help out everyone's inner "Foodie" eat, learn, and love the arts of
       cooking. I never had Web Developer Experience in the work place, but
        I did graduate from Code Fellows and mastered App Development with Ruby
        and Python.
